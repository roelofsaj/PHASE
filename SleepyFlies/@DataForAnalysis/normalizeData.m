% Notes:
% This is an averaging method for activity analysis that normalizes
% activity in each bin as a fraction of the entire day's behavior for
% individual flies. Averaging algorithms by averaging type are as follows:
% Flies: 
%    Sum all raw IR beam crosses for individual flies on a given day, and divide 
%    IR beam crosses within each user-defined bin by that sum. Then, average all 
%    indicated flies normalized values together for each individual day indicated 
%    in ?Days to Use"
% Days: 
%    Average all raw IR beam crosses for days in "Days to Use" by individual fly, 
%    then divide the averaged IR beam crosses within each bin by the day-averaged 
%    sum of all IR beam crosses.
% Both: 
%    First, determines the day-averaged sum of all IR beam crosses per individual 
%    fly in the indicated "Days to Use". Then, divides each flies day- averaged 
%    binned IR beam crosses by the average total IR beam crosses for all days. 
%    Finally, averages all indicated flies normalized activity together. 
% None: 
%    Sum all raw IR beam crosses for individual flies on individual days in 
%    "Days to Use", and divide IR beam crosses within each user-defined bin by that sum.
% (The above are as described by Jenna Persons via email, 2018-10-21)
% In order to otherwise maintain the flow of calculations, we're going to
% normalize each bin by the correct value based on averaging type here and
% then proceed as usual.
