% layDataForAveraging: Shape the data into matrices based on averaging type
% 
% Re-arrange the data to prepare for plotting with averaging, where each
% "layer" (3rd dimension) in the matrix represents a single plot, and
% averaging is done for all rows in each column. (That is, the number of
% points plotted will be the number of columns of data.)
% 
% Usage: (where obj is an object of class SleepyFlies)
%   [plotData, rowLabels, colLabels] = obj.layerDataForAveraging(dataIn);
%   [plotData, rowLabels, colLabels] = obj.layerDataForAveraging(dataIn, averagingMode);
% 
% Inputs:
%   dataIn [FxN int] - Raw data from file to be reshaped
%   averagingMode (optional) - Averaging class object indicating what
%       averaging mode to use. If excluded, obj.AveragingMode will be used.
%       This is included to allow more general use, specifically in
%       normalized averaging of activity data.
%  
% Outputs:
%   plotData [MxOxP int] - Data reshaped as described above.
%   rowLabels {} - Labels for rows of data in plotData
%   colLabels {} - Labels for columns of data in plotData

% needs to have, then we'll stick in an extra dimension for days (the
